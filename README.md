# lambdaPi

An attempt at a Scala version of "[A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus](http://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/)" by Andres LÃ¶h, Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra.

So far, it's just some initial experimenting. More interesting parts might follow, if time permits.
